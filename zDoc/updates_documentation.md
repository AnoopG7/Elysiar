# Elysiar Project Updates Documentation

## June 6, 2025: Dark Theme Implementation

### Changes Implemented
1. **Exclusive Dark Theme**
   - Converted the application to use a dark theme exclusively across all pages
   - Removed theme toggle functionality and associated code
   - Updated color variables in CSS to use dark mode values by default

2. **CSS Updates**
   - Updated `base.css` with dark theme color variables
   - Created `dark-theme.css` for additional dark theme styling
   - Ensured consistent navbar appearance across all pages
   - Applied dark theme to all components (inputs, cards, buttons, etc.)

3. **JavaScript Changes**
   - Added `dark-theme.js` to ensure consistent application of dark theme
   - Removed theme switching logic from other JavaScript files

### Benefits of Dark Theme
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Provides a sleek, contemporary look
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Lower brightness for comfortable viewing, especially at night
- **Battery Efficiency**: Dark themes can save battery life on OLED/AMOLED screens
- **Consistent Experience**: Unified visual experience across the application
- **Improved Content Focus**: Better content contrast and readability

## June 5, 2025: Project Restructuring

### Changes Implemented
1. **CSS Restructuring**
   - Moved all inline styles from HTML files to external CSS files in the css folder
   - Created dedicated CSS files for each HTML page (e.g., settings.css for settings.html)

2. **HTML Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `html` folder to store all HTML files
   - Moved all HTML files from the root directory to the `html` folder
   - Removed the original HTML files from the root directory after confirming the new structure works

3. **Path References**
   - Updated all resource paths in HTML files:
     - CSS paths: `href="../css/file.css"`
     - JavaScript paths: `src="../js/file.js"`
     - Image paths: `src="../images/image.jpg"`

### Benefits of the New Structure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and update files
- **Cleaner Root Directory**: Less clutter in the root directory
- **Better for Version Control**: Clearer differentiation between file types
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features and pages with a consistent structure
